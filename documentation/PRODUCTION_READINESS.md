## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Deploy Rate Limiting to Production ⚡
```bash
cd /Users/rasmusalpsten/Drive\ C/Projects/Canva\ LM
firebase deploy --only functions
```
**Why**: Activate security improvements in production Cloud Functions

### Step 2: Take Chrome Web Store Screenshots 📸
**Required**: 5 screenshots at 1280x800px or 640x400px
1. Main popup with course selector and chat interface
2. AI response with citations and streaming
3. PDF scanning in progress
4. All courses view (expanded window)
5. Settings page with authentication

**Tips**:
- Use a clean test Canvas course
- Show actual functionality, not mockups
- Ensure UI is polished and error-free
- Capture on high-resolution display
- Use Chrome DevTools to set exact dimensions

### Step 3: Clean Up Production Code 🧹
```bash
# Remove deprecated files
rm src/popup-original-77e0b27.js

# Search for console.log statements
grep -r "console.log" src/

# Option A: Remove manually
# Option B: Add to webpack.config.js (recommended)
```

**webpack.config.js addition**:
```javascript
optimization: {
  minimize: true,
  minimizer: [
    new TerserPlugin({
      terserOptions: {
        compress: {
          drop_console: true, // Remove console.* in production
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

### Step 4: Optimize Bundle Size 📦
**Current**: 949 KiB (acceptable but can be improved)
**Target**: < 800 KiB

**Quick wins**:
1. Check if `popup.js` is unused and delete it
2. Lazy load All Courses view component
3. Compress PNG assets further
4. Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer

### Step 5: Set Up Monitoring 📊
**Recommended**: Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry
- Track JavaScript errors in production
- Monitor Cloud Function performance
- Set up alerts for critical failures

### Step 6: Final Testing Round 🧪
Test these critical paths:
1. Fresh install → Sign in → Scan course → Ask question
2. Multiple courses enrollment
3. Chat history persistence
4. PDF upload and deletion
5. Rate limit handling (intentionally exceed limits)

### Step 7: Chrome Web Store Submission 🏁
1. Create Chrome Web Store developer account ($5 one-time fee)
2. Prepare ZIP file from `dist/` folder after build
3. Upload ZIP and fill in store listing with:
   - Screenshots (from Step 2)
   - Privacy Policy URL: `https://github.com/Rasalp1/canvas-lm/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
   - Terms of Service URL: `https://github.com/Rasalp1/canvas-lm/blob/main/TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`
4. Submit for review (typically 1-3 days)
